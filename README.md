This project arose out of a business need to provide advanced analytics for a small ag company with limited IT resources. I proposed this project as a means of freeing the company from a reliance on third parties for all of their advanced analytic needs, as this proved expensive, slow and inefficient. This project allows the company to get up and running easily with ML models for experimentation so as to have a better understanding of what the models do and how they can be useful for any specific data set.

**auger: drilling device (in ag parlance, an auger conveyor moves grain)**

**augur: (noun) ancient Roman official who observed omens for guidance in public affairs; soothsayer
          (verb) predict, prognosticate**
